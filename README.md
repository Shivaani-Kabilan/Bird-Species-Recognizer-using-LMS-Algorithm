# Bird-Species-Recognizer-using-LMS-Algorithm
Bird species identification can be done manually; but, with growing amounts of data, it quickly becomes a repetitive and time-consuming process. In this project, speech recognition techniques are used to create an automated bird sound identification system to help people learn how to recognize bird species from their sounds. A tenth-order LMS adaptive filter is used to remove noise from bird voice signals which are recorded in different environmental conditions where different noise frequencies are present. The design of a tenth-order LMS adaptive filter using MATLAB has been implemented. The performance and characteristics of the filter for five different methods of LMS has been shown. After removal of noise from the noisy bird voice signal using LMS algorithm, cross correlation is used to identify the bird species that it corresponds to.
